//! zki_sieve is an implementation of SIEVEÂ IR.
//!
//! It includes Rust data structures and functions to produce and consume statements.
//!
//! A set of tools to work with SIEVE IR statements is available as a CLI (command line interface).
//!
//! Install and get started with the commands:
//! ```text
//! cargo install --path .
//!
//! zki_sieve help
//! ```
